Build a web app called “Construction Linked Home Loan EMI Calculator”.

Goal
Calculate EMI for a home loan where the bank disburses the loan in multiple stages (construction linked plan). EMI must change after each disbursal.

Core inputs

Total loan approved (example: 75,00,000)

Loan tenure in years (example: 24)

Annual interest rate in % (example: 8.5)

Start date (loan sanction / first disbursal date)

Disbursal schedule as a table with rows:

Disbursal date

Disbursal amount

Rules

EMI is calculated only on the amount disbursed so far.

Each time a new disbursal happens, EMI is recalculated.

The new EMI is calculated on:

Outstanding principal remaining from all previous disbursals combined

Plus the new disbursed amount

For the remaining tenure from that disbursal date until loan end date

Tenure handling

Loan end date = start date + tenure years

Remaining tenure must be computed in days (not only months)

Convert remaining tenure into months using:
remaining_months = remaining_days / 30.4375

Round remaining months to 2 decimals for calculation.

EMI formula
Use standard EMI formula for monthly payments:

monthly_rate = annual_rate / 12 / 100
EMI = P * r * (1+r)^n / ((1+r)^n - 1)

Where
P = principal outstanding at the moment of recalculation
r = monthly_rate
n = remaining_months

Amortization logic
For each EMI period between disbursals:

Simulate month-by-month

For each month:
interest = principal * monthly_rate
principal_paid = EMI - interest
principal = principal - principal_paid

When next disbursal date occurs:

Add the new disbursed amount to principal

Recompute remaining tenure

Recompute EMI

Outputs

EMI timeline table:

Phase number

Phase start date

Phase end date

Principal at phase start

Disbursal added

Remaining tenure months

EMI for this phase

Month-by-month amortization table:

Month date

Opening principal

EMI

Interest

Principal paid

Closing principal

Disbursal added (if any)

Summary:

Total interest paid

Total amount paid

Total disbursed

Final closure date

Final EMI

UI requirements

Clean layout with 2 sections:
Left: inputs
Right: results

Disbursal schedule must allow:
Add row
Remove row
Sort by date automatically

Validate:
Disbursal dates must be >= start date
Total disbursed cannot exceed approved loan
Interest rate > 0
Tenure > 0

Include “Load sample data” button using:
Approved: 75,00,000
Tenure: 24 years
Rate: 8.5%
Start date: 2026-01-01
Disbursals:
2026-01-01 -> 7,50,000
2026-04-08 -> 5,00,000
2026-09-08 -> 8,00,000

Tech requirements

Use React + TypeScript

No backend required

Use a small date library (date-fns)

Use currency formatting for INR

Show charts:

Outstanding principal over time

EMI changes over time

Edge cases

If EMI becomes smaller than monthly interest, flag error (loan will never close)

If last disbursal happens after loan end date, reject

If remaining tenure is less than 1 month, treat as 1 month

Deliverables

Full working code

Single page app

Easy to run with npm install and npm run dev
